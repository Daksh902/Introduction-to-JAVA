Write a program to calculate the total salary of a person. The user has to enter the basic salary (an integer) and the grade (an uppercase character), and depending upon which the total salary is calculated as -
    totalSalary = basic + hra + da + allow – pf
where :
hra   = 20% of basic
da    = 50% of basic
allow = 1700 if grade = ‘A’
allow = 1500 if grade = ‘B’
allow = 1300 if grade = ‘C' or any other character
pf    = 11% of basic.
Round off the total salary and then print the integral part only.
Note for C++ users :
To round off the value , please include<cmath> library in the start of the program.
And round off the values in this way 
int ans = round(yourFinalValue);
Input format :
Basic salary & Grade (separated by space)
Output Format :
Total Salary
Constraints
0<=salary<=10000


import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Write your code here
		int b;
		char grade;
		Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
	
     //   System.out.print(" ");
          b = s.nextInt();
         grade = s.next().charAt(0);
        
         double hra, da, pf, allow, t;
     
             hra = 0.2 * b;
             da = 0.5 * b;
             pf = 0.11 * b;
             allow = 0;
        
        if (grade == 'A') {
            allow = 1700;
        } else if (grade == 'B') {
            allow = 1500;
        } else {
            allow = 1300;
        }
        
         t = b + hra + da + allow - pf;
        
        // Round off the total salary and print the integral part only
        int r = (int) Math.round(t);
        System.out.println(r);

	}
