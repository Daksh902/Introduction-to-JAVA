Given an integer array A of size n. Find and print all the leaders present in the input array. An array element A[i] is called Leader, if all the elements following it (i.e. present at its right) are less than or equal to A[i].
Print all the leader elements separated by space and in the reverse order. That means whichever leader comes at last should be printed first.
Input Format :
Line 1 : Integer n, size of array
Line 2 : Array A elements (separated by space)
Output Format :
 leaders of array (separated by space)
Constraints :
1 <= n <= 10^6




public class Solution {

	public static void leaders(int[] input) {
		

       int n = input.length;
    int max = input[n - 1];
    
    // The last element is always a leader
    System.out.print(max + " ");
    
    // Iterate from the second last element to the first
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        // If the current element is greater than the maximum encountered so far,
        // it is a leader
        if (input[i] > max) {
            max = input[i];
            System.out.print(max + " ");
        }
    }
  }
}
