For a given string(str), remove all the consecutive duplicate characters.
Example:
Input String: "aaaa"

 Input Format:
The first and only line of input contains a string without any leading and trailing spaces. All the characters in the string would be in lower case.
Output Format:
The only line of output prints the updated string.
Note:
You are not required to print anything. It has already been taken care of.
Constraints:
0 <= N <= 10^6
Where N is the length of the input string.

Time Limit: 1 second
